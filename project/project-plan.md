Title
Deforestation and Carbon Emissions in the Amazon - MADE Project

Main Question
How has deforestation in the Amazon contributed to carbon emissions and climate change?

Description
Deforestation in the Amazon has significant implications for carbon emissions and climate change. Forests are essential for carbon sequestration, and deforestation disrupts this process, contributing to higher atmospheric carbon levels. This project will examine the environmental impact of deforestation in the Amazon, specifically focusing on its influence on carbon emissions and broader climate change.

Using multiple datasets, we aim to analyze deforestation patterns, validate satellite data with field observations, and assess the contribution of land-use changes to carbon emissions. By the end of this project, we aim to gain a better understanding of the link between deforestation and climate impact in the Amazon.

Datasources
Brazilian Amazon Fires Dataset (1999-2019)

Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbogernetto/brazilian-amazon-rainforest-degradation)
Data Type: CSV
Description: This dataset contains data on the number of fires detected in the Brazilian Amazon region between 1999 and 2019. It will help assess fire occurrences in the context of deforestation, specifically focusing on the Brazilian Amazon and its role in contributing to carbon emissions.
FAOSTAT Carbon Emissions Data

Source: FAO (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GT/metadata)
Data Type: CSV
Description: This dataset provides data on carbon emissions resulting from land-use changes and deforestation, specifically including carbon stocks in forest biomass. It will be used to quantify emissions resulting from deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.
Work Packages
Data Collection and Preparation

Description: Download and organize the datasets from Kaggle, FAOSTAT, and other sources focusing on Brazilian deforestation.
Tasks:
