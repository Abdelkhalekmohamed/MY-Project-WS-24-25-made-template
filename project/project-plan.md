Title
Deforestation and Carbon Emissions in the Amazon - MADE Project

Main Question
How has deforestation in the Amazon contributed to carbon emissions and climate change?

Description
Deforestation in the Amazon has significant implications for carbon emissions and climate change. Forests are essential for carbon sequestration, and deforestation disrupts this process, contributing to higher atmospheric carbon levels. This project will examine the environmental impact of deforestation in the Amazon, specifically focusing on its influence on carbon emissions and broader climate change.

Using multiple datasets, we aim to analyze deforestation patterns, validate satellite data with field observations, and assess the contribution of land-use changes to carbon emissions. By the project's end, we aim to gain a better understanding of the link between deforestation and climate impact in the Amazon.

Datasources
LBA-ECO LC-22 Field Validation of MODIS Deforestation Detection, Brazil (2003-2004)

Source: ORNL DAAC
Link: https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1262
Data Type: Shapefiles (.shp), CSV files (.csv)
Purpose: This dataset contains field observations and polygons of deforested areas in Mato Grosso, Brazil, used to validate satellite-based deforestation data. It provides essential validation for remote sensing data, ensuring accuracy in analyzing Amazon deforestation patterns.
FAO Carbon Emissions Statistics

Source: FAOSTAT by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
Link: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GT/metadata
Data Type: CSV files
Purpose: This dataset provides data on carbon emissions from land-use changes and forestry, with details on carbon stocks in forest biomass. It enables us to quantify emissions resulting from Amazon deforestation.

Work Packages
Data Collection and Preparation
Description: Download and organize the datasets from ORNL DAAC, FAOSTAT, and Kaggle, ensuring they are structured for analysis.
Tasks:
Confirm dataset accessibility and usage rights.
Organize the datasets in a structured directory.
Initial Data Exploration
Description: Begin exploring the datasets to understand their structure, assess quality, and identify potential issues or gaps in the data.
Tasks:
Load sample data from each dataset.
Check for any data quality issues (e.g., missing values, inconsistencies).
Document findings and observations to guide the data pipeline setup.
Data Analysis and Integration
Description: Integrate datasets and perform core analysis to identify deforestation patterns and calculate carbon emissions.
Tasks:
Develop a processing pipeline to clean, merge, and analyze data.
Calculate carbon emissions based on deforestation metrics.
Visualization and Results Presentation
Description: Create visualizations to present findings and prepare a summary of results.
Tasks:
Generate visualizations (maps, graphs) for deforestation and emissions data.
prepare for the final report and presentation.
